# Fresh project

Your new Fresh project is ready to go. You can follow the Fresh "Getting
Started" guide here: https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/getting-started

### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

Then open http://localhost:8000/product to see the sample product page with cart updates. Product information, images and specs are loaded from `data/product.json`, so you can edit that file to use your own data. The cart count in the navigation bar is updated via HTMX without leaving the page.

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
